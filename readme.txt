--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

### IMPORTANT STUDENT'S NOTE:

a. I've previously made a personal website that coincidentally fulfills many of the requirements of this assignment. I have decided I will not use that website as my submission, but rather create a new one, referencing the previous portfolio and making substantial changes and additions. This website will be my new official portfolio site, and the latter will be out of commission. 

b. I have also shared this repository with my personal GitHub account, jeffreen0322, for future purposes when I wish to make a clone of this repo. Jeffreen3585 is my UCI associated github account.

c. a1-personal-website-jeffreen3585/validation contains 6 screenshots of the validation process. Any validation image that ends with the number 1, it refers to index.html (main page). If the image file ends with a number 2, it refers to contact.html (contact page).

d. There is a javascript file called "index.js" that serves the purpose of giving functionality to sidebar.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

12.5/13
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 2/2 Basic CSS styling
- 2/2 Advanced feature
- 3/3 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

While I did not pass one error, specifically on my contact.html page, the error suggests I need a label to be resolved (given from AChecker), however it is clear enough and doesn't need to be resolved (from UI side).

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

The basic features I've included in this project are the following: 
+ At least one image, with descriptive alt attribute(s)
+ Headings and paragraph text
+ Links to external pages (hyperlinks/buttons)
+ Multiple pages (Portfolio and Contact pages)
+ Google imported fonts

(b) CSS features
+ Modification of padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability.
+ Adding custom fonts from Google fonts
  > Headers of all types: 'Montserrat', sans-serif
  > Pargaphs, bold, strong: 'Open Sans', sans-serif
+ Utilized bootstrap for icons


(c) Advanced features
+ Contact Page to leverage HTML forms.
+ Embedded video media
+ Included page sidebar that allows quick scrolling to section and navigation to new page (contact)


3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
I'm roughly estimating that I took 16 hours on this assignment.

4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)

+ https://www.w3schools.com
+ https://icons.getbootstrap.com
+ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
+ My own personal site I referenced from: https://jeffreen0322.github.io/personal-site/


5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

A classmate I consulted with was Wesley Luong for this assignment. The only thing we discussed relating to the project was how to get the W3C validator to work on our website.

6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

No, there is no special instruction to run my code.
